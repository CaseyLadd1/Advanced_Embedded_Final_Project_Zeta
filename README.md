This project is a collaboration between Sarah Hemler, Paul Karhnak, Casey Ladd, and 

Our product will be a variation on the proposed "cube game" that aims to act as a sort of mini-FPS (first person shooter). We intend to accomplish this by implementing a "point-and-click" reticle that eliminates targets when lined up with them and a button pressed. We also intend to add another layer of complexity to this gameplay by adding in an ammo supply that the player will need to manage. During demo gameplay of the "cube game," we noticed that it was difficult to judge which cubes were the closest to the end of their life, making prioritization of targets more difficult. To remedy this, we plan to add visual indicators for when "cubes" are near the end of their lives.

In addition to these features, we want to use the high color and audio capabilities of the add-on board to create a richer audiovisual experience, with complex sprites and background music.
